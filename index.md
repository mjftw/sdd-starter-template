# <PROJECT NAME> — knowledge bundle

Every markdown artefact in this repository carries OKF frontmatter: a `type`,
`sources` for provenance, `generated` for who drafted it, and `verified` for
who approved it. Filter by type; follow sources; trust `verified` entries
with a `human:` actor.

- [docs/](docs/index.md) — product brief, roadmap, glossary, engineering preferences, decisions, ADRs, guides
- [specs/](specs/index.md) — one directory per vertical slice: intent → spec → plan → tasks → notes
- [memory/constitution.md](memory/constitution.md) — Constitution; highest authority
- [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) — Review Policy
- [log.md](log.md) — chronological history of gates passed

Outside the bundle by design (tool-standard files, no frontmatter):
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.

Artefact types and their fields: [docs/okf.md](docs/okf.md).
