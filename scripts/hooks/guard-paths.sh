blocked: '$REL' is a top-of-ladder artefact (owned by $OWNER) and this turn is running on $MODEL.
Only ${SDD_STRONG_MODELS:-claude-fable-*} may write it (SDD_STRONG_MODELS in .claude/settings.json).
Invoke the \`sdd-continue\` skill (or \`$OWNER\`) to move this turn to the strong model, then retry the same write.
If that does not change the model (the strong model is unavailable to this account), stop and tell the user;
only they may consent to writing it on $MODEL, by creating .sdd/unlock-model.
