# what the capability must do after the change, not the delta alone.

# The brief is read in full by the implementer and the task reviewer on every
# attempt, so it carries only what the task cites: the deltas of the cited
# capabilities (all of them for a task that cites none), the plan's mapping
# rows for the cited requirements plus its Interfaces, Data model, Structure
# and Test strategy, and from AUTONOMY.md only "Who decides".
