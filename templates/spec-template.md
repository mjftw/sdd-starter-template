# Spec: <Feature name>

> **WHAT and WHY only.** No library names, no schema, no file paths, no API
> shapes. If it answers "how", it belongs in `plan.md`.

## Problem

<Two or three sentences. What is wrong or missing today, for whom, and what it
costs them. Not the solution.>

## Outcome

<What is true once this is done, stated so that we could tell from the outside
whether it happened. One paragraph.>

## Users and context

| Actor | Needs to be able to | Cares most about |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Scope

**In scope**
-

**Explicitly out of scope** <!-- the most valuable section in this document -->
-

## Relationship to other slices

| | Slice | How |
|---|---|---|
| Depends on | | |
| Affects | | |
| Shares terms | | (from `docs/glossary.md`) |

## Domain

> From `docs/domain.md`. One context per slice. If this slice needs two, stop:
> either it is two slices, or it is an integration slice whose only job is the
> event/interface between them.

- **Context:** `<name>`
- **Nouns touched:** <from the context's Owns column; glossary terms exactly>
- **Events emitted:** `<NounVerbed>` — <when>
- **Events consumed:** `<NounVerbed>` from `<context>` — <what we do with it>
- **Invariants this slice must preserve:** <from the map; each becomes a REQ below>
- **New invariants this slice introduces:** <each becomes a REQ and a row in the map>

## Requirements

> EARS notation. `SHALL` only. Each has an ID that never changes once approved;
> a withdrawn requirement is struck through, not deleted or renumbered.
> Patterns: ubiquitous · event-driven (`WHEN`) · state-driven (`WHILE`) ·
> unwanted (`IF … THEN`) · optional (`WHERE`). See the `ears` skill.

### REQ-001: <short name>

THE SYSTEM SHALL <observable behaviour>

**Scenarios** — Given / When / Then, real values, observable from outside the
context. One per acceptance path, including the failure paths.

- **REQ-001/S1 — <scenario name>**
  Given <starting state, concrete>
  When <the trigger, concrete>
  Then <the observable outcome, with the actual values>
- **REQ-001/S2 — <failure scenario name>**
  Given <state>
  When <trigger that should be rejected>
  Then <the rejection, exactly as the user sees it>

**Traces to:** <task IDs, filled in by /sdd-tasks>

### REQ-002: <short name>

WHEN <trigger>
THE SYSTEM SHALL <response>

**Scenarios**

- **REQ-002/S1 — <name>**
  Given
  When
  Then

**Traces to:**

## Non-functional requirements

> Only ones with a number in them. "Fast" is not a requirement; "renders in
> under 200 ms at p95 on a cold cache" is. Delete any line you cannot measure.

| Concern | Requirement | How measured |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | | |
| Scale | | |
| Availability | | |
| Security | | |
| Accessibility | | |
| Privacy / data retention | | |

## Edge cases and failure modes

| Situation | Expected behaviour | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Empty / zero / first-run state | | |
| Concurrent or duplicate action | | |
| Upstream dependency unavailable | | |
| Malformed or hostile input | | |
| Partial failure mid-operation | | |

## Assumptions

> Things we are taking as true without having verified them. Each one is a risk.
-

## Open questions

> Anything unresolved. **An agent must not answer these on its own** — it raises
> them. An empty section is a claim that nothing is ambiguous; be honest.

| # | Question | Blocks | Recommended answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | |

## Out of band

<Things a reader would otherwise ask: prior art, related specs, why an obvious
alternative was rejected. Link ADRs in `docs/adr/`.>
