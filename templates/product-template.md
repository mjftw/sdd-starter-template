# <PROJECT NAME>

> What this is, for whom, and under what constraints. Written from the user's
> answers, in the user's words. Every later artefact reads this first.

## In one sentence

<ONE LINE — a stranger would understand it>

## Problem

<What is wrong or missing today, for whom, and what it costs them. Not the
solution.>

## Who it is for

| Who | Situation | What they need to be able to do |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

**Explicitly not for:**
-

## What they do today instead

<and what that costs them>

## Success

<What must be true for version one to count as a success. Observable from
outside. If there is a number, put the number.>

## Out of scope — for the whole project

<Not just v1. Things this project will not do, so no slice ever drifts into
them.>

## Constraints that exist before any code

> Only what is *imposed*: by the users, the environment, the law, the budget,
> the calendar. Anything you are free to choose is left blank here and chosen
> in the first plan, from the whole picture. "I'd like to use X" is a
> preference and goes in `docs/engineering.md`, not here.

| Constraint | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Must run on / where it has to live | | |
| Data location / sovereignty | | |
| Must integrate with | | |
| Licensing | | |
| Deadline / budget | | |

## Lifecycle

- **Deploy:** <how a change reaches users; who can trigger it; how it is reversed>
- **Operate:** <who is on the hook when it breaks; what "broken" means>
- **Retire:** <what would make you abandon this, and what happens to the data>

## Open questions

| # | Question | Recommended answer |
|---|---|---|
