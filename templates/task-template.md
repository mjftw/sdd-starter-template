# CNNN_T0NN · <one outcome>

**Files**
- Create: `<exact path>`
- Modify: `<exact path>:<lines or symbol>`
- Test: `<exact path>`

**Interfaces**
- Consumes: <exact signatures from earlier tasks, naming them: `fn x(a: A) -> B` (CNNN_T010)>
- Produces: `<exact signature this task exposes>` — <one line on semantics>

**Steps**
- [ ] 1. RED — scenario <context>.<capability>/REQ-00X/S1: write the failing test, named after the scenario, through the published interface (the actual test code):
  ```
  <test code>
  ```
- [ ] 2. Run `<exact command>` — expect FAIL: `<exact expected failure>`
- [ ] 3. GREEN — <the smallest implementation, described concretely or as code>
- [ ] 4. Run `<same command>` — expect PASS. Run `<check command>` — green.
- [ ] 5. REFACTOR — <specific cleanup, or "none">

**Verify** — `<exact command>` → `<exact expected output or observation>`
